# ufrii-driver-installscript

Canon's UFRII driver package contains an install script with no option to disable user prompts. I need to install the package in a container, so I'm very hackily disabling them. That's fancy talk for commenting them out. Hopefully publishing this will help others avoid spending time dealing with it.
